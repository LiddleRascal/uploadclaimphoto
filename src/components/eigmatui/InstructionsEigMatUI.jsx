              </li>
              <li>
                Any spoiled foods or perishable goods included in the claim,
                prior to throwing them away
              </li>
              <li>
                Each damaged room or area from a variety of angles
                <ul>
                  <li>Wide-angle views of the room as a whole</li>
                  <li>
                    Photos of the top half of the room (walls and ceiling), as
                    well as the lower half of the room (floor and baseboards) to
                    establish the layout

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Any items that were damaged. If an itemâ€™s location is not

            <b>How to Take Helpful Pictures</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use as much light as possible. Open curtains or blinds, or use a
                light source to allow for clarity Hold your camera as still as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                If needed, steady it on a firm surface or use a tripod Ensure
                that your camera has focused.
              </li>
