### React Flip Move
This module was built to tackle the common but arduous problem of animating a list of items when the list's order changes.

CSS transitions only work for CSS properties. If your list is shuffled, the items have rearranged themselves, but without the use of CSS. The DOM nodes don't know that their on-screen location has changed; from their perspective, they've been removed and inserted elsewhere in the document.

Flip Move uses the FLIP technique to work out what such a transition would look like, and fakes it using 60+ FPS hardware-accelerated CSS transforms.
